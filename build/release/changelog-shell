This file contains a shell for the changelog, followed by a list of every commit for this release.

Choose the appropriate line for the Summary section.

Move all commit notes to the appropriate section.
- Each line should be in the following format:
  [Fixed|Added]: The ticket description. ([Ticket link], [Commit link])
- If the commit is not related to a bug or feature, e.g., whitepsace cleanup, remove it.
- If there is no ticket number, search Trac for the relevant ticket.
  - If there is no ticket, create one (if needed), or leave just the commit link.

Double check that "TICKETREF" does not appear anywhere in the changelog.

Add this changelog to jqueryui.com.
