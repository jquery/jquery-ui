# Contributing to jQuery UI

Welcome! Thanks for your interest in contributing to jQuery UI. Most of our information on how to contribute to this and all other jQuery Foundation projects is over at [contribute.jquery.org](http://contribute.jquery.org). You'll definitely want to take a look at the articles on contributing [code](http://contribute.jquery.org/code).

You may also want to take a look at our [commit & pull request guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/) and [style guides](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/) for instructions on how to maintain your fork and submit your code. Before we can merge any pull request, we'll also need you to sign our [contributor license agreement](http://contribute.jquery.org/cla).

You can find us on [IRC](http://irc.jquery.org), specifically in #jqueryui-dev should you have any questions. If you've never contributed to open source before, we've put together [a short guide with tips, tricks, and ideas on getting started](http://contribute.jquery.org/open-source/). For other forms of discussion and support, please see the [jQuery UI support center](http://jqueryui.com/support/).

## Getting Involved

There are a number of ways to get involved with the development of jQuery UI. Even if you've never contributed code to an Open Source project before, we're always looking for help identifying bugs, writing and reducing test cases and documentation.

This is the best way to contribute to jQuery UI. Please read through the full guide detailing [How to Report Bugs](http://contribute.jquery.org/bug-reports/).

### Weekly Meetings

Every week (unless otherwise noted) the jQuery UI team has a meeting to discuss the progress of current work and to bring forward possible new blockers for discussion. The meeting is held on [IRC](http://irc.jquery.org) in the #jquery-meeting channel at [Noon EST](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=1&day=17&year=2011&hour=12&min=0&sec=0&p1=43) on Wednesdays. Meeting notes are posted on http://meetings.jquery.org/category/ui/ after each meeting.

## Tips For Bug Patching

### Environment: localhost w/ PHP, Node.js & Grunt

jQuery UI uses Node.js & Grunt to automate the building and validation of source code.

Some tests depend on PHP running locally, so make sure you have the following installed:

* A web server with PHP support (any will do, such as [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) or [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html))
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (includes NPM, necessary for the next step)
* Grunt (install with: `npm install -g grunt`

### Build a Local Copy of jQuery UI

Create a fork of the jQuery UI repo on GitHub at http://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.

Change directory to your web root directory, whatever that might be:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/your/www/root/
```

Clone your jQuery UI fork to work locally.

*Note: be sure to replace `[USERNAME]` with your GitHub username.*

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/jquery-ui.git
```

Change to the newly created directory.

```bash
$ cd jquery-ui
```

Add the official jQuery repository as a remote. We recommend naming it "upstream".

```bash
$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.git
```

Get in the habit of pulling in the "upstream" master to stay up to date as jQuery UI receives new commits.

```bash
$ git pull upstream master
```

Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

To lint the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as run a smoke test in PhantomJS, run grunt:

```bash
$ grunt
```

To run the tests for a specific plugin in your browser, open the approriate file from the `/tests/unit/` directory, for example: `http://localhost/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html`. The domain will be dependent on your local server configuation; if there is a port, be sure to include it.

Ideally you would test in all of our [supported browsers](http://jqueryui.com/browser-support/), but if you don't have all of these browsers available, that's ok.

Make sure to read our [commits and pull requests documentation](http://dev.contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/) for full details on working with branches and forks, as well as our commit guidelines.
