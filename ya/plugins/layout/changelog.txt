    o automatically looks for panes inside 'first form' in container
    o if using an ID as paneSelector, pane can be 'deeply nested'

    o overflow: hidden   - ensures no scrollbars on container
    o position: relative - IF NOT: fixed, absolute or relative
    o height:   100%     - IF NOT specified or is 'auto'
